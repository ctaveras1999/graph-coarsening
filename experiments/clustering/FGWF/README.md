# Relational-Factorization-Model

This package includes the implementation of my AAAI 2020 work **"Gromov-Wasserstein Factorization Models for Graph Clustering"** [https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08530]

The examples include clustering two graph datasets:
* AIDS (with node attributes)
* IMDB-BINARY (without node attributes)

More data can be found at [https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets]
